# Day 2: Python Operators

Learned: [Assignment, Membership, Logical, Comparison, Arithmetic]

File: [`Operators`](https://github.com/Oluwatobi-Mustapha/Python/blob/main/operators.py)

# Day 3: Conditional statement

Learned: [ If, elif, else conditional logic, dictionary, String .join() to combine items with separator, Input validation (.lower(), .strip()) ]

Apllied: AWS service mapper

File: [`Condtional statements`](https://github.com/Oluwatobi-Mustapha/Python/blob/main/conditional_statements.py)

# Day 4: lists.

Learned lists and used it to create a basic IAM script.   

Now I  understand the difference between lists (mutable) and tuples (immutable).and  how "if" and "in" are used conditionally. Also comprehended the concept of indexing and how it is used to replace values in a list.

Besides, I touched how list slicing works and how useful it can be, especially during audits.

In Python, an empty list [] evaluates to False, not 0. An error occurs only when accessing an invalid index. 

pop() with no argument removes the last item, while pop(0) removes the first item.

      [`Access key rotator`](https://github.com/Oluwatobi-Mustapha/Python/blob/main/Access_Key_Rotator.py)

      
      
NOTE: You use .index() to convert a Name into a Number, so you can use that number to modify the list, which was what I did in the line 20 of my code
